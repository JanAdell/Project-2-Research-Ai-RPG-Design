# Project 2 Research: AI RPG Design

I am [Jan Adell Mill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-adell-41a5341a3/), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo/).

# Introduction

AI is, in general, an element used in videogames in order for game elements to accomplish functions in a more human-like manner. NPC's actions, being allied, enemy or neutral, are all controlled by AI. 

However, as we will see in this document, AI is an element not only used to give a sense of realism to entities and characters in our videogames, but a game feature which, when used properly, can be useful to enhance the experience in certain manners game developers see fit.

# RPG Games

Role Playing Games (RPG in short) are a genre of videogame based on having the player participate in a story, in which they progress, grow and become more powerful as time goes on and they advance further into the narrative. 

RPGs have been defining the videogame industry from it's very core since the very beggining, serving as examples for many other genres on how to apply certain features and mechanics, mainly progression and character growth. It's important to keep that in mind as we speak of AI, since, as the player grows, we need the environment around him to do as well.

## Different kinds of AI

AI in videogames comes in many different forms. While it can certainly be programmed as to act purely as human-like as possible, AI is a tool for developers to make the player and the world interact in a more immersive manner, making it versatile when it comes to possible paths to take when implementing it.
